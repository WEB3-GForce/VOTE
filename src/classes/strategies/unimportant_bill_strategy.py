          4   Unimportant Bill                        [B]   (UNIMPORTANT-BILL)

          Date-open:     Monday, May 22, 1989
          Symbol:        STRATEGY.681
          Name:          "Unimportant Bill"
          Sort-key:      "BUnimportant Bill"
          Synonyms:      (UNIMPORTANT-BILL)
          Isa-depth:     ""
          Remarks:       Not much riding on this bill.

          Quote:         [Morrison:] some things that are close calls are not treated
                         as close calls because they're not important enough.  I mean
                         its very different if there's enough riding -- either substantively
                         or politically -- on a vote.  You might have exactly the same
                         tensions among the various priorities if you were to pull
                         this up, but it might be about how you spend $100,000 and you
                         say, [this doesn't matter].
          Rank:          "B"
          Test:          Importance of bill is minimal.
        ==================================================================        

    In short, if the bill has a low importance and there is a consensus for the
    decision, vote in line with the consensus.
