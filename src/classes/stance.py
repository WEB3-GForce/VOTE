    Stances are key to VOTE. In short, a stance tells what it's owner feels
    about a given issue. It defines how strongly the owner feels about the
    issue (importance), what side the owner is on (PRO, CON), etc. Typically,
    members and groups hold stances. Bills also contain stances denoting how
    voting for or against the bill will reflect what issues a member supports
    or disapproves of.
    
    Attributes:
        source: An identifier for the source of the relationship. It could be
            an id, name, synonym, etc.
        source_db: The name of the database table that source belongs to
        issue: An identifier of the issue the stance is on
        importance: An _Importance object denoting how important the stance
            is to the source
        side: Whether the source is for (PRO) or against (CON) the issue
        relation: An optional argument. If this stance was adopted from a
            relationship, this entry holds the relationship it was adopted from
        siblings: A list of related stances. The stance_alike(...) method must
