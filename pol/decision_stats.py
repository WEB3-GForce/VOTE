            If one list runs out before the other, the longest list is considered
            to have the most compelling stances.
            
            If one list is found to have a stance of stronger importance than
            the other on a give iteration of the for loop, that side is
            considered to be the most important and is chosen.
        
        Notes to consider:
            
            Consider how to handle this when the sort key is based on EQUITY
            or LOYALTY. Stances are not sorted by strict stance importance, but
            are sorted properly based on those definitions. Hence, it could be
            that there are some "A" stances later on but that aren't considered
            as valuable based on the current support.
            
            This might also change how remove_less_important works. However,
            just keep this simplified version for now.
